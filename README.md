## Technologies Used

- **React 19**: Modern React with hooks
- **Vite 7**: Lightning-fast build tool
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Canvas API**: HTML5 drawing
- **Claude Vision API**: Anthropic's multimodal AI
- **Prism.js**: Syntax highlighting

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Key
Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) to get your Claude API key.

### 2. Draw Your UI
- Use the canvas to sketch buttons, cards, charts, or any UI elements
- Choose different colors and brush sizes
- Add a description for better results

### 3. Generate Code
- Click "Generate UI from Sketch"
- Watch as AI converts your drawing into React code
- View the live preview and copy the code

### 4. Use the Code
- Copy the generated React component
- Paste it into your project
- Customize as needed

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see [SKETCH_TO_UI_README.md](./SKETCH_TO_UI_README.md)

## How It Works

1. **Draw**: Create your UI mockup on the canvas
2. **Capture**: Canvas image is converted to base64 PNG
3. **Analyze**: Claude Vision API interprets the sketch
4. **Generate**: AI creates React component with Tailwind CSS
5. **Render**: Code is displayed and previewed in real-time

## Supported UI Elements

The AI can recognize and generate:
- Buttons and interactive elements
- Cards and containers
- Weather widgets
- Charts and graphs (line, bar, pie)
- Lists and menus
- Text headers and labels
- Icons and decorations
- Forms and inputs
- Navigation bars
- And much more!

## Example Use Cases

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Sketch ideas and get code instantly
- **Design Handoff**: Convert mockups to code
- **Learning**: See how different UI patterns are implemented
- **Experimentation**: Try different designs quickly
- **Wireframing**: Turn wireframes into functional components
